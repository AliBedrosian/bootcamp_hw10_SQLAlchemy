# bootcamp_hw10_SQLAlchemy
Alison McCondichie - Module 10 Challenge - Advanced SQL Alchemy

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of how to use advance SQL skills with SQLAlchemy. 
Part 1 of this challenge is a Jupyter notebook showing queries using SQLAlchemy ORM. We were asked to query for specific data to answer questions based on two databases relating to weather and climate around stations in  Hawaii. Data visualizations are also included to reflect the query results.
Part 2 of this challenge is a .py file creating a Flask API based on the queries in Part 1.
